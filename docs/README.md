# CppSandbox
A handy program to quickly test C++ code.

## How to use it
1. Fire up the program
1. Type in or paste the code. The code must have a ```main``` function.
1. Press ```Command+s``` or ```Ctrl+s``` to "save" the code. It triggers a series of operations under the hood.
1. It will compile and run the code automatically.

## Known limitations
1. No syntax highlighting.
